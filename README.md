Revision Archives
=================

This is an ExpressionEngine extension that documents all entry revisions by generating a PDF on entry additions/edits using PDF Crowd http://pdfcrowd.com/

I created this as a solution during the site development of a publicly traded company that is regulated by the FDA. Due to regularly scheduled Audits there was a need for an automated system that documents every revision that doesn't live just within the database. 

There are a few settings available within the control panel: 

1. PDF Crowd API key. (you can get one here http://pdfcrowd.com/)
2. File output path.
3. Display images?
4. Max image width.

This is a very simple and specific extension that basically has one job to do so few people will require it. If one of those people are you, then enjoy!

If you are looking for more PDF Crowd integration features that utilizes template tags and front end functionality then look here http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/pdfcrowd.
